                India's
                higher education canvas. GIFT City is located 21 km from Ahmedabad, thus putting it on the Indian

                university map.
            </p>
            <h3>Ranking</h3>
            <p>
                Deakin University Australia's strong global reputation directly benefits students at the India campus.
                Deakin is
                ranked 197th globally in the QS World University Rankings 2025, placing it firmly within the top 1% of
                universities
                worldwide. The university ranks 201-250 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025,
                and 177th
                in the US News & World Report Best Global Universities 2024. Deakin University is ranked among the top
                50 young
                universities in the world (under 50 years old), demonstrating its rapid rise to global prominence since
                its
                establishment in Australia in 1974. The university's parent campus consistently receives a 5+ Star
                Rating for
                excellence in teaching, graduate employability, research, and global outlook from the QS Star Rating
                system.
                Deakin also ranks among the top 1% globally for business and management, as well as computer science and
                information systems, according to QS World University Rankings by Subject. This specific subject-area
                strength is
                directly relevant to the degree programs offered at GIFT City, ensuring students receive education that
                is globally
                recognized in their respective fields. The university's parent campus is accredited by the Association
                to Advance
                Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), placing it among the elite 6% of business schools globally with
                international accreditation. It also holds EQUIS and ACS accreditation, further validating the quality
                of education.
                These accreditations ensure that graduates possess the skills, knowledge, and experience sought after by
                employers worldwide. Deakin University has been named Australia's number one public university for
                overall
                student experience, maintaining this position for ten consecutive years. The university ranks as the No.
                1 university
                in the Australian state of Victoria for undergraduate employment outcomes. These rankings demonstrate
                Deakin's
                commitment not just to academic excellence but also to student satisfaction and career success. It goes
                without
                saying that all these accolades, milestones, and achievements trickle down to strategically position the
                university's
                GIFT City campus as the preferred choice for postgraduate technical higher education in India.<br>
                All degrees offered at Deakin India are approved by TEQSA (Tertiary Education Quality and Standards
                Agency),
                Australia's national regulator for higher education. This ensures that the curriculum, teaching quality,
                and
                assessment standards are identical to those at Deakin's Australian campuses. Graduates receive degrees
                that
                carry the full weight of Deakin University's name without any distinction based on campus location.
            </p>
            <h3>Degrees</h3>
            <p>
                Deakin University GIFT City Campus has launched two specialized postgraduate degree programs designed to
                meet India's urgent need for professionals in emerging technology sectors:
            </p>
            <ul style="color:black" class="assist-list">
                <li>Master of Cyber Security (Professional)</li>
                <li>Master of Business Analytics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Master of Cyber Security degree is a comprehensive two-year degree program equipping students with
                advanced skills in protecting digital infrastructure, networks, and data systems. With cyber threats
                escalating
                globally, this degree prepares graduates for high-demand roles in cybersecurity across government
                agencies,
                financial institutions, technology companies, and consulting firms.<br>
                The Master of Business Analytics is also a two-year degree program designed to equip students with
                advanced
                analytical skills to transform data into actionable business insights. This degree focuses on
                statistical analysis,
                predictive modeling, data visualization, and strategic decision-making using innovative analytics tools
                and
                technologies. Students who graduate after completing the degree emerge as data-driven professionals
                capable of
                solving complex business problems across industries, including finance, retail, healthcare, and
                technology.<br>
                Both degrees feature innovative curricula designed to meet industry needs, incorporating practical
                learning, industry
                projects, and work-integrated experiences. The curricula at the GIFT City campus align with Australia's
                national
                accreditation body, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), ensuring identical
                standards to
                those maintained at Deakin University's Australian campuses. Undergraduate degrees have not been
                launched yet
                on the GIFT City campus.<br>
                According to recent industry reports, the highest package offered at Deakin GIFT City in the 2025
                placement cycle
                reached INR 32+ lakh per annum, demonstrating that the campus is already competing with top universities
                in
                India. The average package has been competitive, with most students receiving offers in the INR 12-18
                lakh range.<br>

                International placements have also materialized, with some students receiving offers in Singapore,
                Dubai, and
                Australia, with packages averaging USD 90,000-110,000. Both degree programs are structured with
                flexibility in
                mind, incorporating trimester systems that allow intensive focus on subjects. Students benefit from a
                blend of
                theoretical knowledge and practical application, with emphasis on emerging technologies including
                artificial
                intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and advanced data analytics. Faculty members from Deakin's
                Australian
                campuses regularly visit the India campus for guest lectures, intensive teaching modules, and
                collaborative
                research projects, ensuring continuous knowledge exchange. This "fly-in faculty" model complements the
                resident
                teaching staff, giving students access to Deakin's global academic community. The curriculum integrates
                work-
                integrated learning opportunities, allowing students to apply classroom knowledge in real workplace
                settings. Students participate in live industry projects, case studies from real companies, and
                internships that
                often convert to
                pre-placement offers. This hands-on approach ensures graduates are not just job-ready but also
                innovation-ready.

                engage with
                cutting-edge developments in their fields. The university's research strengths are particularly
                impressive in areas
                such as health, artificial intelligence, sustainability, nanotechnology, and data analytics. Deakin
                established a joint
                center focused on nanotechnology and sustainability with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), one
                of
                India's leading research organizations. This collaboration exemplifies the university's commitment to
                addressing
                global challenges through research partnerships. The university continues to foster research
                collaborations with
                Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) launched 30 years ago, working on pioneering projects in various
                technology
                domains. These long-standing partnerships demonstrate Deakin's integration into India's research
                ecosystem and
                commitment to contributing to India's scientific and technological advancement.<br>
                At the GIFT City campus, faculty members are actively engaged in research, and students have
                opportunities to
                participate in research projects, industry-sponsored studies, and innovation initiatives. This research
                exposure
                enriches the educational experience, develops critical thinking skills, and prepares students for
                research-oriented
                career paths or further academic pursuits.<br>
                During the 30 Years of Impact celebrations in 2024, Deakin University announced a commitment to
                investing AUD 1
                million for strategic initiatives in higher education, sports, and disaster management in India. The
                university has also
                committed to assisting the National Institute of Disaster Management in building disaster-resilience
                architecture in
                India. These initiatives demonstrate Deakin's ongoing commitment to contributing to India's 360-degree
                development through research and knowledge exchange.<br>

            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
                The Deakin University GIFT City campus is strategically positioned in GIFT City, India's first
                operational greenfield
                smart city designed to become a global financial and information technology hub. Located in the
                Gandhinagar
                district of Gujarat, between the state capital Gandhinagar and the commercial hub Ahmedabad, GIFT City
                represents India's premier International Financial Services Center (IFSC). The campus occupies
                purpose-built
                facilities within this smart business precinct, placing students alongside global and domestic business
                enterprises.
                The Deakin GIFT City Campus features world-class facilities designed specifically for modern technology
                education. The state-of-the-art 25,000-square-foot campus reflects cutting-edge design and construction
                practices.
                The innovative design of the campus replicates the quality and standards of Deakin's Australian
                campuses. The
                library, for instance, provides both physical and digital resources to support student research and
                learning. Study
                spaces and collaborative areas encourage both individual focus and group projects. The campus also
                features the
                Clinical Exercise Center supporting student wellness, and various social spaces promoting interaction
                and
                community building. Deakin GIFT City has partnered with upscale and high-end accommodation providers to
                offer
                housing options near the campus. The recommended accommodation options include Geeta Residency, which
                offers both boys' and girls' accommodations, and Union Living, which provides girls-only accommodation.
                The
                hostel facilities are located off-campus but in proximity to GIFT City, ensuring convenient access for
                students. Most
                accommodations offer twin-sharing rooms with modern amenities. The campus cafeteria provides regular
                meals.
                This all-inclusive approach helps students and their families budget effectively for the academic year.
                Hostel
                facilities typically include 24/7 security with CCTV surveillance, laundry services, library and study
                spaces,
                gymnasium facilities, on-site ambulance services, and partnerships with local hospitals for healthcare
                needs. These
                comprehensive facilities ensure students can focus on their academic pursuits while maintaining their
                health and
                well-being. The off-campus accommodation model allows students to experience independent living while
                remaining connected to the campus community. Both regular shuttle services and convenient public
                transportation
                options connect accommodation facilities to the campus.
