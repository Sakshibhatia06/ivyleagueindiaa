      <h3>Ivy League India Copyright Notice</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      The website <strong>www.IvyLeagueIndia.com</strong> is fully protected globally by US and international
      copyright law. You are not permitted, in any way, shape, or form, to replicate our content either directly,
      indirectly, or consequently for both personal and professional use.
      Since we routinely monitor the worldwide web for copyright infringements and our content is watermarked,
      the chances of violations being detected are very high.To explain in detail how copyright
works, we hav provided a brief overview below:
    </p>
    <p>
      Copyright refers to a branch of intellectual property law that aims to protect creations such as websites, books,
music and art. When you create something new, copyright law automatically gives you full ownership rights in your
creation.
    </p>
    <p>For example if you write a screenplay, novel, or even a blog post, you've just created something new. Once you put
that creation out into the world and
allow the public to access it, copyright law kicks in to help make sure that someone else can't steal a part of (or all
of your creation.</p>
<p>
  If someone does do something to violate your copyright, like copy your blog post and attribute it to himself, or try to
claim authorship of your screenplay, copyright law makes it possible for you to enforce your rights against the other and maintain your ownership. You
do not need to register your copyright with any organization or government.
</p>
<p>While it's not statutorily required to register your copyright, registering comes with some benefits that make the time
and fee worth spending. Perhaps the biggest benefit by far is that you'll have the ability to bring a lawsuit against
someone who infringes your copyright if you've registered
your copyright.</p>
<p>While it's not unheard of to wait until someone infringes your rights to register your copyright and bring suit, you'll
have a much stronger case if you
can show that your copyright has been registered for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>While copyright notices aren't required by any law, they're incredibly helpful to people who wish to legally protect
their work. Basically, anything that you create and share with the public but still keep the public from copying or
appropriating in full or in part would benefit
from having a copyright notice:</p>
   <ul style="color:black" class="assist-list">
    <li>People will be put on notice that your work is yours,
and that it is subject to copyright</li>
    <li>In the event that you need to bring legal action against someone for copying your work, having a copyright notice
in place can be a very useful thing.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Showing the court that you had a copyright notice up may help you support your case against infringers by making
it easier for you to prove that the alleged
infringer knew, or was put on notice, that your work was copyrighted.
   </p>

    <h3 style="color:black">Note</h3>
    <p>however, that due to the complex nature of copyright law, it hasn't been proven in court that a copyright notice
will make an absolute difference
in your case given all of the other potential factors involved in copyright infringement.</p>
<ul style="color:black" class="assist-list">
    <li>A copyright notice can help deter infringement/plagiarism, and</li>
    <li>You can use the notice to declare what rights you wish to maintain.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>A statement of rights is not a requirement. By default, a copyright notice will work to reserve all of your rights, so
stating something like "All Rights Reserved" isn't technically necessary. However, it is commonly seen this way and clarity of your rights can't hurt.</p>
<p>The universally accepted symbol for a copyright is the letter C in a circle: © You can also use the word "copyright."
If you keep a mix of old and new content in your copyrighted medium, your copyright date may be a range rather
than a single year. The copyright author's name can be the name of an individual, multiple individuals, an
organization's name, or a business/corporate name, so long as it
identifies who holds the copyright on the material.</p>
<p>This helps people identify you or your business and shows clear and specific ownership of the material:</p>

    <h4 style="color:black">There are 3 main types of rights most copyright notices will maintain:</h4>
    <ul style="color:black" class="assist-list">
      <li><strong>All Rights Reserved:</strong>This is by far the most commonly used and seen statement of rights in copyrighted materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Some Rights Reserved:</strong>Seen in
Creative Commons licensing.<br>
You may allow use of your materials under certain circumstances, like only with full attribute to you, and no
alteration can be done to your original material.<br>
Stock photos are a common example of this reservation of rights.
</li>
      <li><strong>No Rights Reserved:</strong> Sometimes you'll want to declare ownership of something, but not make that restrictive for
the rest of the world.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <p>
      Interestingly, the famous "I "<"3 NY" logo was designed by Milton Glaser in 1977 and he kept no personal copyright
on the design.<br>
(The city of New York, New York does have trademark rights to the image, but that's another article topic.)<br>
You can't copyright ideas, but you can copyright your personal and unique expressions of ideas. You should
consider adding a copyright notice if you're releasing something into the public that you created and want to protect.
    </p>
    <p>If you've created a mobile app, recorded a song, written a book, blog post, or other published writing, or any other
unique expression of ideas, you will want a copyright notice. The main point of your notice is to make sure that
anyone who views your work knows that the work is copyrighted. This means that where you should place your
copyright notice will change depending on what type of material or format you're putting your notice on. For
example, a website should have a notice on the bottom of every page, while a book should have just one notice,
most likely at the beginning of the
book.</p>

    <h4 style="color:black">Some other standard places for copyright notices include the following:</h4>
    <ul style="color:black" class="assist-list">
      <li>CDs, cassettes and LPs should have one copyright notice on any included and accompanying inserts, sleeves or
booklets</li>
      <li>Promotional Items, leaflets, commercial documents, etc. should have one copyright notice per item</li>
      <li>Manuscripts and screenplays should have one copyright notice on the front</li>
      <li>Digital photography, graphic design and other digital artistic mediums should have one copyright notice toward the
bottom of the work, or a watermark notice if desired</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Copyright notices can help protect the textual and visual content of your website. Most websites include a copyright
notice in the footer of the site, and on every single webpage. Using a circled "C" instead of the word "Copyright" is also sufficient as this symbol is
universally recognized as the symbol for a copyright.
    </p>
    <p>It's easy to include a copyright notice somewhere within your mobile app. Different companies display their notices
in different locations throughout their
apps.</p>
<p>We hope that the above explanation explains to you the nature of copyright protection and deters you from copying
our content without written permission.</p>
